# How to Starat Your Own Business

The paradox of starting your own business lies in the simultaneous challenge and reward, making it an experience unlike any other. So many businesses fail, and most entrepreneurs exclude themselves from the possibility. The tragic reality is that when businesses fail, the passion often dies with it. By following some sound advice and being prepared for the process, you will decrease your chances of losing a lot more than you bargained for. I have recently started a business and have learned some crucial lessons in the process that I feel privileged to share with you.

开始你自己的生意的矛盾在于挑战和回报同时并存，也不像其他有经验可以依循。有如此多的生意失败，绝大多数的创业者被成功的可能排除在外。悲催的是当你失意失败，激情也随之消亡。在准备做生意之前听取一些适当的建议，可以大大减少你独自鼓捣时产生损失的机会。我最近开始做生意，学到了流程中一些关键的课程，很高兴与你分享下。

1.Identify your motivation. Why do you want to start your own business?To have more time ? To make more money ? To be your own boss ? To have creative control over what you love to do ? Write out all of your motivating factors and prioritize them. When you see them listed, you might see a pattern in that you're just unhappy at your current job and starting your own business isn't the answer.

1、查验你的动机为什么你想要自己创业？想要更多的时间？想要更多的收入？想要成为自己的老板？还是想要增加自己对喜欢的一切的掌控力？把你的动机因素都一一列出来，并且按重要性排好顺序。当你看着这张清单，你可能会看到这样一个模式，你只是由于不满意现在的工作而想去开始自己的生意，然而这并不是正确的答案。

2. Identify your passion. What do you love to do ? What skills and knowledge do you uniquely bring to the table ? What gets you excited about your work ? Keep that passion at the forefront of your business plan, your marketing strategies, and your daily routine. If you keep your passion in plain sight, you will stay focused on the purpose of your business and not solely on the logistics.

2、查验你的激情你喜欢做的是什么？你有什么独特的可以拿得出手的能力和知识？你工作中的哪些让你感到兴奋？始终保持你的激情在你的生意计划，你的市场策略以及你的日常节奏。假如你要把你的激情放在显而易见的地方，你应该专注在你的生意目标而不只是物流。

3. Identify your market. If you are starting your business locally, research your competitors. Determine if there is room in the market for your business. What will you do differently to draw in customers ? What niche market are the other businesses missing ? If you are starting an Internet company, research the requirements for your own unique Web presence. Your business cannot survive without customers, so do enough research on the front end to determine of there are enough potential clients to keep your business alive.

3、查验你的市场如果你是在本地开始创业，搜索你的竞争者。确认你的生意在市场上是否还有空间？你向客户描述（生意）时有什么不同点？有哪些商机是其他人遗漏了的？如果你开的是网络公司，搜索设备做你独一无二的网站。没有客户你的生意无法生存，所以在做最终的决定前做好足够的搜索，看是否有足够的潜在客户来让你生意存活。

4. Identify your finances. If you have even purchased a new home, you know that the financial obligations extend beyond the down payment and the mortgage. You have to buy furniture, trash ans, a garage door opener, light fixtures and landscaping equipment, and before you know it, you've far exceeded your financial boundaries. That can happen just as easily in a business. Do exhaustive financial planning. Meet with a financial advisor or someone at your bank to examine the financial viability of your business and the process of getting it up and running. Plan wisely and do not assume the best about your business. Be prepared for financial loss and get advice on how to alleviate that burden in the future.

4、查验你的财务如果你刚买了一所新房子，你该知道债务不只包括房子首付和月供，还有你需要买的家具、垃圾桶、门的遥控器、灯具和景观的固定设施，当你意识到这些时，已经远远超出财务预算。相比较而言，这一切在生意上更容易发生。做一个详尽的财务计划，和你的财务顾问或银行的某个人谈一谈，评估生意启动和运营上你的财务可行性。明智的计划，而不要光设想生意最好的状况，为未来财务上的损失做准备，以及听取减轻负担的意见。

5. Identify your support system. Seek out advice from seasoned business owners, even those in your own field.Develop relationships with people who can offer sound advice and criticism that you might not see. If there is a business owner in your community or in your network that you aspire to model, examine his or hers business practices and how they handle various situations. Ask for counsel before big decisions, and even create your own makeshift Board of Directors to help guide you in the planning and start-up process.

5、查验你的支持系统挑选丰富经验的老板们的建议，哪怕他们和你在同一领域。结交那些可以给你提供你看不到的合理建议和批评的人。如果在你的小区或者人际网里有一个老板是你想要成为的对象，调查他/她经营生意的方式，以及他们是如何处理各种情况。在做一个大决定前寻求忠告，哪怕开发你自己临时的董事会，在计划和流程启动前用来保护你。

Once you have all of these elements in place, you are prepared to start the process of developing a business plan, applying for a license, establishing a marketing presence, etc. Owning your own business can be unparalleled in the professional world, and if you surround yourself with wise counsel, you can have a career that daily feeds your passion.

一旦你把这一切的因素都考虑进来，你已经准备好启动和开发你的生意计划，就可以申请执照，建立市场营销等。拥有自己的生意在职业生涯里是绝无仅有的体验，如果你持续保持明智的建议，你将拥有一份每天激情满满的工作。
