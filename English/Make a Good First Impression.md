# Make a Good First Impression

At a dinner party in New York, one of the guests, a woman who had inherited money, was eager to make a pleasing impression on everyone. So had squandered a modest fortune on sables, diamonds and pearls. But she hadn't done anything whatsoever about her face. It radiated sourness and selfishness. She didn't realize what everyone knows: namely, the expression one wears on one's face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one's back.

Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says, "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you." That is why dogs make such a hit. They are so glad to see us that they almost jump out of their skins. So, naturally, we are glad to see them.

A baby's smile has the same effect.

Have you ever been in a doctor's waiting room and looked around at all the glum faces waiting impatiently to be seen ? Dr. Stephen K. Sproul, a veterinarian in Raytown, Missouri, told of a typical Spring day when his waiting room was full of clients waiting to have their pets inoculated. No one was talking to anyone else, and all were probably thinking of a dozen other things they would rather be doing than"wasting time" sitting in that office. He told one of our classes:

"There were six or seven clients waiting when a young woman came in with a nine-month-old baby and a kitten. As luck would have it, she sat down next to a gentleman who was more than a little distraught about the long wait for service. The next things he knew, the baby just looked up at him with that great big smile that is so characteristic of babies. What did that gentleman do ? Just what you and I would do, of course; he smiled back at the baby. Soon he struck up a conversation with the woman about her baby and his grandchildren, and soon the entire reception room joined in, and the boredom and tension were converted into a pleasant and enjoyable experience."

The ancient Chinese were a wise lit----wise in the ways of the world; and they had a proverb that you and I ought to cut out and paste inside our hats. It goes like this, "A man without a smiling face must not open a shop."

Your smile is messenger of your goodwill. Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it. To someone who has seen a dozen people frown, scowl or turn their faces away, your smile is like the sun breaking through the clouds. Especially when that someone is under pressure form his bosses, his customers, his teachers or parents or children, a smile can help him realize that all is not hopeless----that there is joy in the world.
